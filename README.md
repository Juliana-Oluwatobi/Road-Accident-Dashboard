# Road-Accident-Dashboard
Explorative analysis to understand the severity of road accidents in a geographical location
## Project Overview
The Road Accident Dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive and interactive visualization of road accident data. The goal is to support traffic authorities, urban planners, researchers, and the general public in identifying patterns, high-risk zones, and trends over time, thereby enabling data-driven decisions to improve road safety.

## Key Features
Interactive Visualizations: Charts, heat maps, and tables representing accident severity, causes, time, location, vehicle types, and victim demographics.
Filters and Drilldowns: Dynamic filters to analyze data by time (month/year), accident type, location (state/city/district), weather conditions, etc.
Trend Analysis: Line graphs and statistical summaries showing trends over time.
Severity Breakdown: Visual representation of fatalities, serious injuries, and minor injuries.

## Benefits
- Identify high-risk locations and times for proactive intervention

- Support public awareness and policy formulation

- Enable real-time monitoring (if live data feeds are integrated)

- Reduce accident rates through targeted safety measures
  
## Potential Users
- Road and traffic authorities
- Policy makers and urban planners
- Public safety departments
- Researchers and NGOs focused on road safety

  
## Key Metrics
Accident Statistics
-Total Number of Accidents
-Accidents by Severity
-Fatal 1.7%
-Serious Injury 14.2%
-Minor Injury 84.1%

Accidents by Region / State / District
-Urban vs. Rural Accident Distribution
-Accidents by Road Type

Time-Based Metrics
-Accidents by Time of Day
-Accidents by Day of Week
-Accidents by Month / Year
-Trends Over Time (Monthly/Yearly)

Vehicle Types Involved

Two-Wheelers, Cars, Trucks, Buses, etc.

Environmental & Road Conditions

Weather Conditions During Accident

Dry, Wet, Snow/Ice

Road Conditions
Single carriageway, Dual Carriageway, Roundabout, Oneway street etc 

Light Conditions

Technology Stack
Dashboard Tool: Microsoft Excel 

Data Sources:
Government APIs / Open Data Portals

Dashboard features:
Interactive filters by accident severity, casualty by road type, casualty by road surface, and location.

Data Overview
Shape of the Dataset: Number of rows (records) and columns (features)

## Data Types 
Identify numeric, categorical, datetime, and geospatial features
Missing Values: Percentage of missing data per column
Duplicate Records: Check for and handle duplicate entries
Unique Values: For key categorical columns (e.g., accident types, vehicle types)

## Recommendation/Actionable Insights

Install better lighting and signage at accident hotspots.

Increase law enforcement visibility during high-risk hours (night, weekends).

Public awareness campaigns should focus on young drivers and rural areas.

Invest in emergency response infrastructure in rural zones.

Limitations 

1. Data Quality & Completeness
   Missing or Incomplete Data: Not all accident records contain detailed information (e.g., missing location coordinates, unknown causes, or driver details).
   Underreporting: Minor accidents and hit-and-run cases are often not reported to authorities.

2. Delayed Updates: Government or agency data may not be updated in real-time, leading to outdated insights.

3. Data Granularity
 Lack of Real-Time Data: Most dashboards rely on historical or annual data, limiting real-time decision-making.

4. Limited Demographic Info: Some datasets may lack detailed age, gender, or medical outcomes of victims.

5. Geographic & Infrastructure Bias

Urban-Centric Data: Urban areas are more likely to have detailed reports, resulting in rural accidents being underrepresented.

Infrastructure Differences: Comparisons across regions may be unfair due to varying road conditions, vehicle types, and enforcement policies.
